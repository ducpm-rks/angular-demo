Angular 7 Project: Comprehensive Example
This project is an Angular 7 application demonstrating various core Angular features, including routing, lifecycle hooks, inter-component communication, and integration with state management (Redux via NgRx). It's set up with both Karma for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

Features
This application showcases the following Angular functionalities accessible via the main navigation:

Test Lifecycle Hooks: Demonstrates various Angular component lifecycle hooks.

Test Interceptor, Guard, Resolver: Examples of implementing HTTP interceptors, route guards, and resolvers.

Test Pass Data Between Components: Illustrates different methods of passing data between Angular components (e.g., @Input, @Output, services).

Test Redux: Integration with NgRx for state management following the Redux pattern.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 16.x is recommended and has been used for this project setup. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Note: Using a Node.js version significantly different from 16.x might lead to compatibility issues with Angular 7 or its dependencies.

npm: Comes bundled with Node.js.

Angular CLI: While the project is set up, having the Angular CLI installed globally can be helpful for running commands.

npm install -g @angular/cli@7

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd angular-demo

Install dependencies:

npm install

This command will install all the necessary project dependencies, including Angular, Karma, Jasmine, and Cypress.

Development Server
Run ng serve for a development server. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

npm start
# or
ng serve

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Running Unit Tests
This project uses Karma and Jasmine for unit testing.

To execute the unit tests via Karma:

npm test
# or
ng test

This command will open a Chrome browser instance and display the test results.

Running End-to-End Tests
This project uses Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) testing.

Important: Before running Cypress tests, ensure your Angular development server is running in a separate terminal.

Start the Angular application:

npm start
# or
ng serve

Keep this terminal open.

Open the Cypress Test Runner UI:
In a new terminal, run:

npm run cypress:open

This will open the Cypress desktop application, allowing you to interactively select and run your E2E tests.

Run Cypress tests headless (for CI/CD):
To run all E2E tests in a headless browser (without opening the UI), use:

npm run cypress:run

This is ideal for automated environments like CI/CD pipelines.

Code Linting
Run ng lint to execute the TSLint checks.

npm run lint
# or
ng lint

Building the Application
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.

npm run build
# or
ng build

The application is optimized for production by default (--prod is implied in Angular 7 production configuration).

Important Notes
Node.js Version: This project is configured and tested primarily with Node.js version 16.x. While it might work with other Node 16.x minor versions, using Node.js 18 or newer might introduce compatibility issues with Angular 7's dependencies, especially @angular-devkit/build-angular.

Angular Version: This project is locked to Angular 7.2.16. Avoid updating core Angular packages unless you intend to migrate the entire project to a newer Angular version, which would require significant refactoring due to breaking changes across major Angular versions.

Cypress Configuration: Cypress tests are configured via cypress.json in the project root and cypress/tsconfig.json for TypeScript compilation within the Cypress environment.
